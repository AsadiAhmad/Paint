## How to Use

This app is not running on the Google colab because it's a application that get realtime pictures from server so google colab can't respond too fast and it crashes too fast so you need have a jupyter notebook on your PC i suggest you to install jyputer extensions from VSCode.

After placing the code on the jupyter notebook just run step 1 and 2 draw your picture and run step 3 for saving your picture.

## Controls

  - `r` button reset the screen and make it white screen
  - `z` button delete the pervious draw when press it long works just like r button
  - `esc` button exit from application and saves your last picture

## Result
